ASPNET DEPLOY HEROKU WITH DOCKER
-------------------------------------

Backup After ( worldgift-giveaway-backend ) Deployed From Github.

Rferred From => https://medium.com/@oluwabukunmi.aluko/dockerize-asp-net-core-web-app-with-multiple-layers-projects-part1-2256aa1b0511

Build App Inside Main Directory => docker build -f ArchiSolveApi/Dockerfile -t archisolveapi-image .

Run Container => docker run --name archisolveapi-container -p 3000:80 -d archisolveapi-image


Stop Docker Container => docker stop archisolveapi-container -t 0

Remove Docker Container => docker rm archisolveapi-container

Check App If Is Up Running => docker logs 3d57db9c9bbd

Stop and Remove => docker stop 3d57db9c9bbd docker rm 3d57db9c9bbd


Start SQL Server Container With Credentials =>  docker run --name=archisolveapi-server -e 'ACCEPT_EULA=Y' -e 'SA_PASSWORD=1StrongPwd!!' -p 1433:1433 -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest

Connect to SQL Server Management Studio =>

       localhost,1433
       SA
       1StrongPwd!!

Create Directory For Backup => Docker exec -it archisolveapi-server mkdir /var/opt/mssql/backups


Copy And Paste Backup-File From Origin To Destination into container and Window => docker cp "C:\Users\this PC\Downloads\ArchiSolveDb.bak" archisolveapi-server:"/var/opt/mssql/backups" 

Copy And Paste Backup-File From Origin To Destination into container (var/opt/mssql/backups -> mssql) => Docker cp ./mssql/ArchiSolveDb.bak archisolveapi-server:/var/opt/mssql/backups

Copy And Paste Backup-File From Origin To Destination into container and Window => docker cp "C:\Users\this PC\Downloads\ArchiSolveDb.bak" archisolveapi_db_1:"/var/backups" 

Download SQL Server Image => docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest

Check SQL Server Container Working IP=> docker inspect archisolveapi-server | findstr "IP"

Restart Container/s Which only Hold Changes => docker-compose up --detach --build

docker-compose up --detach --build worker

docker-compose up --detach --build archisolveapi_db_1

docker-compose stop -t 1 worker
docker-compose build worker
docker-compose up --no-start worker
docker-compose start worker

DEPLOY DOCKER COMPOSE TO HEROKU

- Create heroku.yml file and Paste compose.yaml

- docker tag 8246841c6324 registry.heroku.com/archisolveapi-backend/web

HEROKU DEPLOY WITH DOCKER
------------------------------

First add => Dockerfile with all required scripts

Build App => docker build . --tag bandhan-backend-image


Re-Build App => docker build --tag bandhan-backend-image .


Check Running Image => docker images


    REPOSITORY                   TAG          IMAGE ID          CREATED            SIZE
    bandhan-backend-image        latest       437e181f1154      2 minutes ago      1.08GB


Create and check Running Container Same Option as Local [Start App] not recommended => docker run -it -p 3000:3000 bandhan-backend-image


Create and check Running Container [Start App] => docker run --name bandhan-backend-container -p 3000:3000 -d bandhan-backend-image


   7cfcc7c1b1221f837b5e80c3be6dcfaf5a55a64a1c1becd37669672de4ebf18b


Check Running Container => docker ps

Check App If Is Up Running => docker logs 7cfcc7c1b122

Check Heroku CLI if it is installed => heroku --version

Login Into Heroku => heroku login

Check Available Container => docker ps

Login Into Container => heroku container:login

Heroku Push Command => heroku container:push web --app backend-bandhan-docker

Heroku Release Changes => heroku container:release web --app backend-bandhan-docker

Heroku Open Command or Use Browser => heroku open --app backend-bandhan-docker


Stop and Remove Docker Container => docker stop 7cfcc7c1b122 docker rm 7cfcc7c1b122

Stop Docker Container => docker stop bandhan-backend-container -t 0

Start Container With Logs => docker start -ai archisolveapi_db_1

Remove Docker Container => docker rm bandhan-backend-container

Remove Docker Container => docker rmi -f eeaceea81ce6 (imageID)

Restart Docker Container => docker start container_name



Docker Push Command [Useless at the moment] => docker push registry.heroku.com/backend-bandhan-docker/web


Check Into Created Container
-----------------------------

Check Installed Packages => docker exec struxe-server-container npm list
Enter Into Container => docker exec -it container name bash
Out Into Container => exit

Hello Paypal, my name is Josue, and I hope you are doing great.
Anyway, I have faced with the issue where I spent a couple of days 
waiting for onfirmation code SMS, but still - I didn't get/receive 
any Code yet into my SMS inbox and I want to verify my account by start 
receiving the money from a friend who lives in India - Simply, he already 
transferred some money for testing transfer but I am not able to receive it.






I was been in this career for around three years and I have been working 
in different markets place in all of those years - but after applying around 
more than 68 times fails I have seen that it is difficult to get hired in Europe 
as well as US markets. So, due to my research, I made I really hope that once I will
get a chance to join this course provided by code fellows I will get the required skills
to use as well as better connection.




Definitely yes. I do have experience in coding. Some of the resources I used, was the lecture courses I unrolled when I was in college - where I was unrolling my courses in Information and Technology. I also passed in Andela Mark Zuckerberg Bootcamp. Some of the stacks I use are Adobe XD, Photoshop, BuilderX and APIs, Meteor.js, Node.js, Express, socket.io, React, Redux as well as HTML, SASS, and CSS expert having 5 years of experience creating modern websites with Nodejs as backend part and React, Redux as frontend part with Mongo DB, MySQL DB, and PostgreSQL DB together with AWS, Heroku, Netlify, I worked on Rivopets Web Application, Cititaksi Web Dashboard Application, Heritage Vet+ Apk backend
, etc... My Github profile link is https://github.com/key-joshua, but some of the client's projects I worked
on are private. Again  my LinkedIn profile link is https://www.linkedin.com/in/josue-byiringiro/



The good thing which is surprisingly, I was responsive to my family and seven siblings around 2 years
before my big brother got a job in Japan. And I did my best to cover all the required things that were
needed at home.
